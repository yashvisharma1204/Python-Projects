Process of Data Communication,The exchange of data between two or more devices through a transmission medium following specific rules (protocols).
Components,"Transmitter, Receiver, Medium, Message, Protocol"
Transmitter,Prepares the data for transmission and sends it.
Receiver,Receives the transmitted data and converts it back to its original form.
Medium,"The physical path through which data travels (e.g., cable, radio waves)."
Message,The actual data being communicated.
Protocol,A set of rules that govern data communication.
"Protocols, Standards, Standard Organizations",Protocols ensure compatibility between devices. Standards define specific protocols. Organizations like IEEE create and maintain these standards.
"Bandwidth, Data Transmission Rate",The amount of data a medium can transmit in a unit of time (usually measured in Hertz [Hz]).
Baud Rate,The speed at which data is transferred (bits per second [bps]).
Bits per Second,The number of signal events per second (not directly equivalent to bps).
Analog Signal,"A continuously varying signal representing data (e.g., sound wave)."
Digital Signal,"A signal composed of discrete steps representing data (e.g., 0s and 1s)."
Analog to Digital,Converting analog signals to digital for transmission.
Digital to Analog Conversion,Converting digital signals back to analog for use by devices.
Computer Network,Interconnected devices that share resources and communicate with each other.
Network Benefits,"Resource sharing, improved communication, reliability, cost-effectiveness."
LAN,"Covers a small geographic area (e.g., office building)."
WAN,"Covers a large geographic area (e.g., the internet)."
MAN,"Covers a metropolitan area (e.g., city-wide network)."
Peer-to-Peer,Devices communicate directly with each other.
Client-Server,Dedicated server provides resources to client devices.

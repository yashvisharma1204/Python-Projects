# ðŸ’» Peer to peer Simulation Code

Welcome to the **Simulation Code** repository! This collection contains several Python script designed to simulate peer to peer scenarios. Each file contributes to different aspects of the simulation, from basic setups to complex interactions. Feel free to explore and run the scripts to see the simulations in action.

## ðŸ“‚ Files

Here are the main files in this repository:

- **`simulation_code.py`**: Core script for running the simulation. It handles the main logic and operations for the simulation.
- **`third.py`**: A part of the simulation, likely an additional or secondary script related to the main simulation.
- **`client2.py`**: A client-side script that interacts with the simulation, performing specific tasks.
- **`document.txt`**: A text file with documentation or notes related to the simulation.
- **`example.txt`**: An example file showing input or output data formats used in the simulation.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x** - The main programming language for the simulation code.
- **Various Python libraries** - Depending on the simulation's complexity, various libraries may be required (e.g., `time`, `random`, etc.).

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yashvisharma1204/python-projects.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the simulation folder**:
   ```bash
   cd simulation_code
   ```
3. **Run the simulation**:
   Execute the main script or any specific script to see the simulation in action. For example:
   ```bash
   python simulation_code.py
   ```

4. **View outputs**: After running the simulation, check `example.txt` for sample outputs or logs that explain the results.
